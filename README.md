## Problem 

There are many online resources for gaining new skills but there are no affordable courses in a classroom setting. Chalkdust helps people save money on expensive courses by allowing them to learn from the people that utilize the required skills on a daily basis. The instructors display their profiles on Chalkdust, which incorporates their skills, jobs, certificates, etc. from LinkedIn, and the students determine whether the instructors are up to their standards.

## Solution 

A site where instructors (everyday people) can post courses and students (again everyday people trying to learn new skills) can evaluate the teacher based on the user profile which shows off the intructors projects and brings in their skills, etc. from the LinkedIn API. 

## Libraries, Gems, and other technologies 

- jQuery
- Backbone.js 
- Slick.js
- Moment.js
- Handlebars.js
- Underscore.js 
- Moment.js
- Checkout.js
- Accounting.js

- LinkedIn API 
- LiquidSpace API 
- Stripe API 

- fog gem 
- carrierwave gem 
- figaro gem 
- omniauth-linkedin-oauth2 gem 

## Sore bits 

- SVG loads depending on internet connectivity 
- switching between backbone and rails views 

## Cool beans 

- interactive AND dynamic SVG 
- access to full LinkedIn profile 
- aesthetic instructor page 

## Next steps 

- incorporate the LiquidSpace API 
- search feature for courses and categories 
- geocoder so that only courses in your area show 
- show the students registered for your course 
- use the interactive JavaScript maps for the home page (http://www.amcharts.com/)

## Thank you
